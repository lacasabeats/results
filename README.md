Responsive design with css


Hi! I'm a newbie and this is my second challenge. 

I created a div for each element and a lot of class. 'Ul' for the summary section with differents 'class' (sum-box).
For the circle designing I did a div with border-radius at 50%. The content inside the circle will be here.

I did it in 5 hours so I think it's too much time. What do you think?
I will appreciate any feedback or improve, you can directly modify the code ;)
